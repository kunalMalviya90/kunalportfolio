Build a modern 3D responsive Software Developer Portfolio Website for Kunal Malviya using MERN stack or pure JavaScript (HTML, CSS, JS, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB) — whichever gives the best performance on Replit.

✅ Design goals:

Full dark mode UI with smooth scroll, soft animations, and 3D elements (like 3D profile image hover, 3D project cards, and animated background using Three.js or Framer Motion).

Use a quadratic color palette (blend of electric blue #00BFFF, violet #7B68EE, neon purple #8A2BE2, and jet black #0A0A0A) with glassmorphism and gradient highlights.

The site must be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Include profile photo section, subtle background motion effects, and smooth page transitions.

✅ Website structure:

Hero Section:

Animated introduction like “Hi, I’m Kunal Malviya 👋 — Software Engineer | MERN & Java Developer.”

3D floating name effect and animated buttons linking to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Email.
